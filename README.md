# `rig`

A package with some helpful abstractions and utilities.

## Contents

* [`algorithm`](algorithm/README.md) contains generic functions that are similar to the C++ 
Standard Template Library (`<algorithm.h>`).

* [`containers`](containers/README.md) has various "container" like abstractions.
Currently only a `Stack` generics implementation exists, but hoping to expand
to match something similar to the C++ containers defined in [`absl`](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/tree/master/absl/container)
